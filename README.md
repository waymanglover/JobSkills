# JobSkills
Build a SQLite database of developer job postings from [We Work Remotely](https://weworkremotely.com/) from their RSS feed, with the eventual goal of finding what skills are most in demand.

Also a good excuse to learn and use [Python type annotations](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html).
